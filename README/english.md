It is a game that you can use to study how life works, it is not difficult to put it to work and it works on all computers.

It is made with python easy and simple to activate it

To activate it you will need: python pygame numpy

A few things to keep in mind in the "stick automata" part is blocked because I found errors if we use both, if we want to activate it, deactivate it by putting a # in front of the command in mobile automata and you will see how it will work.

enjoy it
